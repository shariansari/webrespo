    <div className="sociality">SOCIALITY</div>
    <div className="soc"><p>Socialism as a system of shared resources and collective production dates back to the earliest human civilizations. Tribal or clan-based societies would often work for the common good and work together to produce enough food and supplies for the entire population. Collective agriculture persisted for thousands of years. This was replaced in many places by some sort of feudal system, whereby landed nobility (lords) ruled over peasants (serfs) who worked the land without owning it. Socialism's intellectual roots date back to Plato's "Republic," in which he described a collective society. Centuries later, Thomas More's "Utopia" echoed Platonic ideals in its depiction of an imaginary island where people live and work communally. But socialism was a direct response to the Industrial Revolution, which brought enormous economic and social change to Great Britain and the rest of the world. As industrialists grew wealthy on the labor of workers who increasingly lived in poverty, socialism emerged as an alternative to capitalism, one that could improve life for the working class.</p></div>
